  # Airbnb Clone Web Design

  This is a code bundle for Airbnb Clone Web Design. The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/JQH0sUcG1aqAN3atciUSmb/Airbnb-Clone-Web-Design.

  ## Running the code

  Run `npm i` to install the dependencies.

  Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

  ## What's added (internship-ready polish)

  - React Router-based pages: Home and Listing details (navigate to `/listing/:id`).
  - Search bar that filters listings by location/description (desktop and mobile modal).
  - Category filtering with sticky navbar and shadow for a professional look.
  - Listing detail page with large image, description, price, rating and a Reserve button (UI only).
  - Dummy loading skeletons and helpful empty states.
  - Responsive grid and subtle hover effects for a polished UI.

  Note: After pulling changes run `npm i` to install `react-router-dom` before running the dev server.
